## Che's Awesome Three dimensional toolS
Make things 3D with WebGL without going through the pain.<br>

It can draw things 3D, and you can move the camera around, add lighting, and more.

## Download
At the moment I haven't created a distribution file. Once I do though, you can download it [here](https://yuchestart.github.io/CATS). <br>
